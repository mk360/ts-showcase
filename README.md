# ts-showcase

Introductory repository that aims to demonstrate TypeScript features in an easy-to-digest fashion.

## Navigating

This repository is divided into topics. Each topic is broken down into many .ts files, each containing a specific use case or scenario explaining the topic in question.

Each file contains step-by-step demonstrations of the use case, with explanatory comments.

The examples are for Typescript v.4.5.5 (as of February 3rd, 2022).

## Notes

You may run into TypeScript errors while viewing this repository inside your IDE. This is normal.

This repository not only intends to teach how to use a feature well, but also what happens if something is used wrong.
